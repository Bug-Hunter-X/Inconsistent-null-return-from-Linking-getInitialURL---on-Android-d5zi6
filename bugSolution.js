The provided code doesn't directly fix the Expo `Linking` bug, as the root cause lies within the Expo library itself. However, it demonstrates a workaround by attempting to handle the `null` case gracefully.  A more robust solution would involve checking `Intent` data directly on Android (requiring native modules), which is significantly more complex.  This example simply adds a fallback and logging to improve debugging.

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => {
  if (url) {
    // Handle URL
    console.log('Initial URL:', url);
  } else {
    // Handle null URL - Fallback mechanism
    console.log('Initial URL is null.  Attempting fallback...');
    // Here you might add more sophisticated fallback logic, such as 
    // checking Intent data directly using a native module (if necessary).
  }
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error getting initial URL:', error);
});
```
